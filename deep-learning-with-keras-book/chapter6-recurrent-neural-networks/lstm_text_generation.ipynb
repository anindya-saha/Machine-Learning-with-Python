    "LSTMs have been used extensively by the **natural language processing (NLP)** community for various applications. One such application is building language models. A language model allows us to predict the probability of a word in a text given the previous words. Language models are important for various higher level tasks such as machine translation, spelling correction, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "A side effect of the ability to predict the next word given previous words is a generative model that allows us to generate text by sampling from the output probabilities. In language modeling, our input is typically a sequence of words and the output is a sequence of predicted words. The training data used is existing unlabeled text, where we set the label $y_t$ at time $t$ to be the input $x_{t+1}$ at time $t+1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example of using Keras for building LSTMs, we will train a character based language model on the text of *Alice in Wonderland* to predict the next character given 10 previous characters. We have chosen to build a character-based model here because it has a smaller vocabulary and trains quicker. The idea is the same as using a word-based language model, except we use characters instead of words. We will then use the trained model to generate some text in the same style."

    "Finally, we are ready to build our model. We define the LSTM's output dimension to have a size of 128. This is a hyper-parameter that needs to be determined by experimentation. In general, if we choose too small a size, then the model does not have sufficient capacity for generating good text, and you will see long runs of repeating characters or runs of repeating word groups. On the other hand, if the value chosen is too large, the model has too many parameters and needs a lot more data to train effectively. We want to return a single character as output, not a sequence of characters, so `return_sequences=False`. We have already seen that the input to the LSTM is of shape (`SEQLEN` and `nb_chars`). In addition, we set `unroll=True` because it improves performance on the TensorFlow backend.\n",

    "Generating the next character or next word of text is not the only thing you can do with this sort of model. This kind of model has been successfully used to make stock predictions (for more information refer to the article: *Financial Market Time Series Prediction with Recurrent Neural Networks*, by A. Bernal, S. Fok, and R. Pidaparthi, 2012) and generate classical music (for more information refer to the article: *DeepBach: A Steerable Model for Bach Chorales Generation*, by G. Hadjeres and F. Pachet, arXiv:1612.01010, 2016), to name a few interesting applications. Andrej Karpathy covers a few other fun examples, such as generating fake Wikipedia pages, algebraic geometry proofs, and Linux source code in his blog post at: *The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks at http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/*."
