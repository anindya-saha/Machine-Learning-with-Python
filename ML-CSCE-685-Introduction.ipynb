    "**Supervised learning:** The computer is presented with a set of labelled example inputs and their desired labelled outputs, given by a \"teacher\". Supervised learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function from the labeled training data that maps inputs to outputs. Each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal). The learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. An optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances. This requires the learning algorithm to generalize from the training data to unseen situations in a \"reasonable\" way."

    "**Regression** is an instance of Supervised machine learning task and is a predictive modeling technique where the target variable to be estimated is continuous. It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (or 'predictors' or 'features'). More specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or 'criterion variable') changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed. The estimation goal is a function of the independent variables called the **regression function**.\n",

    "**Reinforcement Learning:** A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle), without a teacher explicitly telling it whether it has come close to its goal or not. Another example is learning to play a game of backgammon by playing against an opponent. The technique of reinforcement learning is concerned with the problem of finding suitable actions to take in a given situation in order to maximize a reward. Here the learning algorithm is not given examples of optimal outputs, in contrast to supervised learning, but must instead discover them by a process of trial and error. Typically there is a sequence of states and actions in which the learning algorithm is interacting with its environment. In many cases, the current action not only affects the immediate reward but also has an impact on the reward at all subsequent time steps. A general feature of reinforcement learning is the trade-off between _exploration_, in which the system tries out new kinds of actions to see how effective they are, and _exploitation_, in which the system makes use of actions that are known to yield a high reward. Too strong a focus on either exploration or exploitation will yield poor results.\n",
