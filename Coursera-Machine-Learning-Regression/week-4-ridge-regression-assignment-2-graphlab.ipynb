    "Answer: No Regularization: 243.0541689, High Regularization: 91.48927361\n",
    "2. What are the RSS on the test data for each of the set of weights above (initial, no regularization, high regularization)?  \n",
    "Answer: initial: \\$1784273282524564.000000, no regularization: \\$274067618287245.187500, high regularization: \\$500404800579555.437500\n",
    "3. We make prediction for the first house in the test set using two sets of weights (no regularization vs high regularization). Which weights make better prediction <u>for that particular house</u>?  \n",
    "Answer: no regularization vs high regularization: price diff of 77465.4764647 vs 39546.4696951. Hence, high regularization."
